*change-hash-syntax.txt*                        change-hash-syntax


This plugin changes Ruby hash syntax to 1.9

# before
hash = { :one => 1, :two => 2 }

# after
hash = { one: 1, two: 2 }


                                                *ChangeHashSyntax*

To change hash syntax, just call :ChangeHashSyntax.  By default it
operates on the entire file.  Pass a range (or use V to select some lines)
to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed.
