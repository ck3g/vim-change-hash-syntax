# Change Hash Syntax

This plugin chnages Ruby hash syntax to 1.9

    # before
    hash = { :one => 1, :two => 2 }

    # after
    hash = { one: 1, two: 2 }


# How to use

To change hash syntax, just call `:ChangeHashSyntax`.  By default it
operates on the entire file.  Pass a range (or use V to select some lines)
to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed.
